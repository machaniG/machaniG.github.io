# Executive Summary

This analysis empowered Crimsonloop to move beyond a one-size-fits-all strategy by segmenting our diverse customer base into four distinct tiers. My findings reveal that two customer segments, the Premium and Loyalty tiers, drive 74% of our revenue. Our high-value segment, customers who have a single-transaction value over $1,000, represent only 2.8% of our customers but contribute 13% of revenue. The analysis goes further to define and validate customer lifetime value (LTV), revealing that the Elite tier, despite its small size, holds the highest average LTV, solidifying their status as a key business asset. By focusing on these high-value segments, we can develop targeted, high-impact marketing strategies, ultimately enhancing customer retention and driving significant revenue growth.


# My Approach: From Hypothesis to Actionable Insights

My approach to this project was driven by a core hypothesis: **a small but highly valuable segment of customers exists within our long-tail sales distribution, and by identifying and understanding them, we can unlock significant revenue growth.**
After preprocessing and integrating multiple datasets, I used a two-pronged approach to validate this hypothesis. First, I used a **rule-based segmentation** to define four distinct customer tiers based on their transaction values. This allowed for a clear, immediate understanding of our customer base, paving the way for targeted marketing and resource allocation.

To validate these business-driven segments, I applied **K-means clustering**, an unsupervised learning algorithm, to see if the data naturally formed similar groups. The results were compelling:
- Cluster 3 showed a strong alignment with the Elite Tier, reinforcing its distinctiveness.
- The Loyalty, Premium, and Regular Tiers were primarily distributed across Cluster 0 and Cluster 2, suggesting a natural grouping of mid-to-low value customers that could be explored for more granular targeting.

This synergy between the business rules and the data's inherent structure provided a strong foundation for the analysis. The project culminated in a set of dashboards designed to provide real-time insights into our customer base.

# Key Discoveries & Actionable Insights

## 1. Unveiling High-Value Customers & Segmentation

Initial analysis revealed a right-skewed distribution of sales and a "long tail" between the 99th percentile and the maximum transaction value, signaling high-value customer opportunities. This prompted me to perform customer segmentation and analyze their unique behaviors and preferences.
My rule-based segmentation identified the **Elite segment** as customers who have at least one single-transaction value over $1,000. This group is made up of 41 customers out of 1,468, representing only 2.8% of our customer base. They are all returning customers and generated 13.1% of revenue in 2019.
While this segment is defined by their high-value purchases, it's important to note that the average transaction value for the Elite tier is $115.31. This is because this average includes all their transactions, not just the single large ones that qualified them for the tier. Their average transaction value is still significantly higher than the Premium and Loyalty tiers, whose averages are $78.01 and $67.47, respectively.

## 2. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) Analysis

Building on the initial segmentation, I calculated the **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** for each segment. While the rule-based segmentation identified customers based on a single high-value transaction, LTV provides a more holistic view by summing the total revenue generated by each customer over their entire purchasing history. This analysis confirmed that our Elite Tier customers are not only high-value on a per-transaction basis but are also our most valuable customers overall.
The analysis revealed a clear hierarchy of value:
   -	**Elite Tier:** $28,227.58
   -	**Premium Tier:** $10,796.32
   -	**Loyalty Tier:** $4,572.79
   -	**Regular Tier:** $1,347.56
This finding further justifies a concentrated effort on retention and personalized marketing for the Elite group. The Premium (17.6% of customers) and Loyalty (34.6% of customers) tiers are our largest revenue drivers, contributing 36.4% and 38.1% of total revenue, respectively. Conversely, the Regular tier, which accounts for 45% of our customers, generates the least amount of revenue at 12.5%. The key takeaway is to develop distinct strategies for each segment: nurture the high-value Elite customers for long-term loyalty and growth, while implementing scale-friendly, efficient marketing for the mid-to-low value segments.

## 3. Uncovering Product Preferences

The analysis revealed that a single product category, **Nest-USA**, generates 55.1% of our revenue. However, the most units sold were in the **Office** category, followed by Apparel and Drinkware. While the Office category leads with 88k units sold, it generates only 6% of total revenue due to its low average unit cost of $3.8, compared to Nest-USA's average unit cost of $124.3. The inventory manager can leverage this insight for procurement to balance supply and demand.

## 4. Geographic and Gender Insights

Most of our revenue comes from **California and Chicago**, which accounted for 65% of total revenue in 2019. These two regions have 920 out of our 1,468 customers and more than half of our high-value customers, that is; 28 Elite, 159 Premium, and 313 Loyalty customers.

## 5. Critical Temporal Trends

After analyzing temporal trends over time, I uncovered a notable spike of sales in 5th & 18th April, 18th July, and 27th November with 5th April leading in revenue generated. My analysis revealed that the spikes observed in the overall sales are driven primarily by transactions from the Elite segment. This highlights a critical insight: the revenue generated by this small group of customers has an outsized impact on our business's overall performance. 

We generated more revenue in November ($406,866) followed by October ($367,271) and December ($366,280). June was the lowest month with only $223,357 in sales. Although there are spikes of sales in April and July, the sum of sales is only $357,159 for April and $332,562 for July. Further analysis revealed that transactions cluster on Wednesdays through Sunday with a peak on Fridays, highlighting a clear pattern for operational adjustments. We expect little traffic on Mondays and Tuesdays. This clear seasonality in sales can be used by both the marketing and supply chain departments to optimize timing for promotions and restocking.

# What's Missing to Make This a Great Project?

To take this project to the next level, I would focus on two key areas:
- Predictive Analysis: I would build a model to predict which customers are likely to transition into the Elite tier based on their purchase history and demographic data. This would allow for proactive, not just reactive, targeting.
- A/B Testing Framework: I would design a framework for A/B testing targeted marketing campaigns. This would include defining key performance indicators (KPIs) and a clear methodology for measuring the impact of personalized offers on the Elite tier's revenue contribution.

This project is a strong demonstration of my ability to use data to solve a clear business problem. The combination of hypothesis-driven analysis, multiple methodologies, and actionable recommendations shows a comprehensive understanding of the data science lifecycle.
