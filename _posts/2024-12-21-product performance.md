# Introduction

This project leverages interactive Tableau dashboards to explore and explain key business drivers for a modern fashion retail brand, Fashionfit. The analysis delivers actionable insights tailored for executive leadership and product management, supporting data-driven decision-making across all levels of the organization.

## The Challenge

Fashionfit was determined to optimize its merchandising strategy and boost profitability. They needed a clear, data-driven understanding of their product performance across categories, regions, and time to inform strategic decisions on inventory, marketing, and sales. They struggled to pinpoint key growth drivers and identify underperforming areas effectively. The analysis is presented in three focused Tableau dashboards:

**Executive Summary:** A high-level overview of core performance indicators, highlighting top-line sales, profitability, and month-on-month growth across regions and categories. Designed for quick business health appraisal, it equips decision-makers to track progress and respond to emerging trends.

**Product Performance:** A deep dive into individual product categories and SKUs, uncovering which lines drive revenue and profit, and where opportunities or underperformers lie. Interactive visuals reveal sales versus profits, trends, and top-performing products to guide targeted inventory and marketing action.

**Quantity Sold:** Tracks quantities sold by product categories and SKUs, allowing the product team to identify slow versus fast movers to support timely restocking, minimize losses, and ensure alignment between sales and supply chain, helping optimize inventory.

## Analysis Objectives

Identify product categories and items with the strongest and weakest sales and profitability.

Visualize revenue, cost, and margin trends over time to assess seasonal effects and growth momentum.

Equip the Fashionfit team with clear, actionable recommendations for inventory optimization, promotional focus, and strategic investment.

## My Approach:

I designed and developed a comprehensive suite of fully interactive dashboards in Tableau, integrating sales, profit, and quantity sold data from 2018 to 2021. My process involved:

Data Integration & Transformation: Consolidating raw sales data into a clean, unified dataset.

Key Metric Calculation: Deriving essential KPIs such as MoM growth rates, profit margins, and category-specific performance.

Visualization & Dashboard Design: Crafting intuitive and insightful visualizations that allowed for deep dives into product performance.

# Key Discoveries & Actionable Insights:

Through rigorous analysis and interactive dashboards, I uncovered critical insights that directly informed business strategy:

**Dominant Categories & Underperforming Lines:**

Hoodies & Sweatshirts and Jackets consistently emerged as the top-performing product categories, driving the majority of sales and profits across all regions. Conversely, Bras & Tops significantly underperformed. My analysis indicated this was likely due to their exclusive sale to women, who represented a smaller fraction of the overall customer base. This provided a crucial insight for potential product line adjustments or targeted marketing campaigns.

As illustrated in the Executive Summary Dashboard below, observe the clear distribution of sales and profits by category and region.

**Dynamic Profit Leaders & Rising Stars:**

The landscape of top-performing products was dynamic, highlighting the need for continuous monitoring. For example, in 2019, Orion Two-Tone Fitted Jacket led in profit with £31,819, while Hyperion Elements Jacket stood at £14,786. By 2021, the top earners shifted, demonstrating the importance of agile strategy. A standout success story was "Frankie Sweatshirt," which saw a remarkable increase in profits from £13,720 in 2020 to £20,550 in 2021. This identified a high-growth product that warranted further investment and marketing focus.

**Seasonal Fluctuations & Inventory Optimization:**

Overall quantity sold showed clear seasonal trends, peaking at an all-time high of 5,907 units in May 2021 and dropping to a low of 3,484 units in November 2021. Month-over-month sales growth rates revealed significant volatility, indicating the need for more agile inventory planning and targeted promotional activities during anticipated dips.

This critical seasonal trend is clearly visualized in the Quantity Sold Dashboard below, showing fluctuations in units sold over time.

# Business Impact:

This project provided the client with unparalleled clarity into their product ecosystem. The insights empowered them to:

Strategically optimize their product portfolio, focusing resources on high-potential categories and re-evaluating underperforming ones.

Make informed inventory decisions, aligning stock levels with anticipated seasonal demands to minimize dead stock and maximize sales.

Direct marketing efforts towards profitable products and customer segments, enhancing ROI.

This analysis ultimately enabled the client to move beyond guesswork, fostering a data-driven approach to product strategy that supports measurable growth and profitability.
