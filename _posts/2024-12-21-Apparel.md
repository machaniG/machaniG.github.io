This is a dashboard is an overview of sales and profitability insights for a multi-channel apparel retailer. The dashboard is fully interactive and you can even select a product, city, or year and view the sales and profits for that particular metric. 

Because Power BI limits sharing dashboards for free accounts, I unfortunately cannot share in the form of .pbix where you can enjoy the interactivity.
